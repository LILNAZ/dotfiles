## Theme
I am think of starting with dracula, but as they have themes for almost anything I could reverse engineer the theme to variables for ansible later

- https://github.com/dracula/zsh
- https://github.com/dracula/gtk
- https://github.com/dracula/tmux
- https://github.com/dracula/alacritty
- https://github.com/dracula/i3
	- Sway should be compatible with this i3 config
